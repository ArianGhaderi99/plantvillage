# üåø Plant Disease Detection Website

This project is a web application powered by artificial intelligence that allows users to upload images of their plants and flowers to detect possible diseases. The system uses a deep learning model (MobileNetV2) to analyze the image and return the result to the user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Django** ‚Äì Main backend framework  
- **Redis & Celery** ‚Äì For task queue and background processing  
- **SQLite** ‚Äì Lightweight local database  
- **HTML & CSS** ‚Äì Frontend design  
- **MobileNetV2** ‚Äì Deep learning model for image classification  

## üß† About the AI Model

We used the **MobileNetV2** model, which is lightweight, fast, and suitable for web-based applications. The trained model runs on the server side and processes the uploaded image to detect any plant diseases.
